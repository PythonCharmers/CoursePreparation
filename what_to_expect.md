# What to Expect

This section describes what to expect in your upcoming training course with Python Charmers.

## Timing

Your training course will normally run from 9:00 to roughly 17:00 each day, with breaks of 50 minutes for lunch and 20 minutes each for morning and afternoon tea.

We highly recommend that you arrive or connect by **8:40am** (20 minutes early) on the first day so you can settle in and find your way around and get set up before the course starts.

Break times (approximate):

- 10:40am to 11:00am
- 12:40pm to 1:30pm
- 3:00pm to 3:20pm

## Format

Each topic is a mixture of hands-on exercises and expert instruction.

## Exercises

There will be practical programming exercises throughout the course. These will be challenging and fun, and the solutions will be discussed after each exercise and provided as source code on the USB sticks. During the exercises, the trainer will offer individual help and suggestions.

## Questions

We encourage an interactive and dynamic learning atmosphere. If you ask questions in the course as they arise in your mind, you will have more fun, learn faster, and your questions will probably help others who have similar questions.

## Personal help

Your trainer(s) will be available after the course each day for you to ask any one-on-one questions you like — whether about the course material and exercises or about specific problems you face in your work and how to use Python to solve them.

## Hosted courses

**Computer:** For training courses we host, we will provide an internet-connected computer for you during the course.

**Food and drink:** For training courses we host, we will provide lunch, morning and afternoon tea, and drinks. Please let us know at <info@pythoncharmers.com> if you have special dietary requirements.

## On-site courses

For training courses on-site at your company or organization's premises, please bring a laptop with:

- a 64-bit operating system: Windows, Linux, or macOS
- at least 8 GB RAM, 15 GB disk space
- internet access (preferably)
- (preferably) USB access

**Software setup:** If possible, prior to the course, please install the latest Anaconda Python 3.x. Detailed installation instructions are
[here](https://prep.pythoncharmers.com/installation).

## Online courses

For online training courses, we recommend the following hardware and software:

**Audio / Video:** a webcam and headset with microphone or (preferably) a quiet room to allow you to collaborate effectively.

**Computer:** at least 8 GB of RAM and a 64-bit operating system (Windows, Linux, or macOS). If possible, we recommend using multiple screens.

**Browser:** Chrome, Firefox, or Safari (not IE or Edge). You will be able to use your browser to access our cloud server for coding during the course.

You can also optionally install the following software on your computer.  You
will not need this during the course but we would recommend this setup for your
use afterwards:

- The latest Anaconda Python 3 pre-installed (for your user account only): https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section
- The latest Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

## Supplemental materials

In face-to-face courses, we will give you printed course notes and a USB stick containing many useful Python-related resources.

In online courses, you will have access to these resources via our cloud server and you can download them for your own use after the course.

The materials include:

- the course content (PDF or printed)
- solutions to the exercises as Python code
- individual chapters as *Jupyter* notebooks
- cheat sheets
- reference documentation on Pytohn and the 3rd-party packages covered in the course
- sample datasets

### Post-course assistance

We are happy to offer answers to questions in the weeks following the training course, to ensure that you can make progress immediately with using Python for real work. We also offer formal consulting for direction and support with code and team architecture, building web services and data analytics tools, and providing further customised training in specific tools.

### Certificate of completion

We will provide you a certificate if you complete the course and successfully answer the majority of the exercise questions.

## Questions?

You are welcome to contact us if you have any questions prior to your training
course. You can reach us at <help@pythoncharmers.com>.

You are also welcome to send us sample datasets or specific problems that you
would like us to look at in advance. We can either incorporate these into the
training course or answer your questions personally if you wish.

We look forward to seeing you soon!
