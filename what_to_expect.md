# What to Expect

This section describes what to expect in your upcoming training course with Python Charmers.

## Timing

Your training course will normally run from 9:00 to roughly 17:00 each day, with breaks of 50 minutes for lunch and 20 minutes each for morning and afternoon tea. We recommend that you arrive by 8:45am on the first day so you can settle in before the course starts.

## Exercises

There will be practical programming exercises throughout the course.

## Questions

We encourage an interactive and dynamic learning atmosphere. If you ask questions in the course as they arise in your mind, you will have more fun, learn faster, and your questions will probably help others who have similar questions.

## Personal help

Your trainer(s) will be available after the course each day for you to ask any one-on-one questions you like â€” whether about the course material and exercises or about specific problems you face in your work and how to use Python to solve them.

## Hosted courses

**Computer:** For training courses we host, we will provide an internet-connected computer for you during the course.

**Food and drink:** For training courses we host, we will provide lunch, morning and afternoon tea, and drinks. Please let us know at <info@pythoncharmers.com> if you have special dietary requirements.

## On-site courses

For training courses on-site at your company or organization's premises, please bring a laptop with:

- a 64-bit operating system: Windows, Linux, or macOS
- at least 8 GB RAM, 15 GB disk space
- internet access (preferably)
- (preferably) USB access

**Software setup:** If possible, prior to the course, please install the latest Anaconda Python 3.x. Detailed installation instructions are
[here](https://prep.pythoncharmers.com/installation).

## Supplemental materials

We will supply you with printed course notes and a USB stick containing many useful Python-related resources.

### USB stick

The USB stick contains kitchen-sink Python installers for multiple platforms,
*Jupyter* notebooks containing the course content, solutions to the exercises,
several written tutorials, and reference documentation on Python and the
3rd-party packages covered in the course.

## Questions?

You are welcome to contact us if you have any questions prior to your training
course. You can reach us at <help@pythoncharmers.com>.

You are also welcome to send us sample datasets or specific problems that you
would like us to look at in advance. We can either incorporate these into the
training course or answer your questions personally if you wish.

We look forward to seeing you soon!
