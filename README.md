# Welcome!

We are delighted that you will be attending a Python training course run by
[Python Charmers](https://pythoncharmers.com)! These materials describe how best
to prepare for the course.

These materials are based on the free online book "A Byte of Python" by Swaroop
C H but customized by Python Charmers to be optimal as pre-course reading for
Python Charmers' [Introduction to
Python](https://pythoncharmers.com/training/introduction-to-python/) course and
other courses.

It includes a tutorial or introductory guide to the Python language \(version 3\) for a beginner audience. If all you know about computers is how to save text files, then this is the book for you.
